# Twaccess
Twaccess is a google sheets add on which allows users to pull in search data from twitter. The application does not store twitter handles making it ideal for governments and other organizations which do not wish to store personal information.   Twaccess uses twitters search APIs to bring in tweets according to the user's search terms, it then takes the Klout score for each twitter user who tweeted about the subject. This data is added to a spreadsheet where the user can manipulate the data as they need.
